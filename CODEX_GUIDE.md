## Ticket-first
Only implement work that exists as a ticket.
Do not expand scope beyond the ticket.

## Required output after changes
- Summary of changes

- How to test in Unity (exact steps)

## Guardrails
- No real network access
- No real exploit logic
- Keep all hacking mechanics simulated and fictional
